# Movie_API

Exercise Objective: To build the server-side component of a “movies” web
application. This will provide users with access to information about
different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign
up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
movies.

This API is hosted on heroku.

It is currently being used for both my MyFlix (React and Angular) files
found here on Github:

and
