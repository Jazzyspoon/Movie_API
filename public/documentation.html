      <h5>Exercise Objective:</h5>
      <p>
        To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The
        web application will provide users with access to information about
        different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up,
        update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
        movies.

            Science fiction (sometimes shortened to sci-fi or SF) is a genre of

            the 'literature of ideas', and often explores the potential

            Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists
            are thrust into a<br />
            series of events that typically include violence, extended fighting,
            physical feats, rescues and frantic chases. Action films tend to
            feature a mostly resourceful hero struggling against incredible
            odds, which include life-threatening situations, a dangerous
            villain, or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the
            hero (though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the
            victory for the villain instead).

            Horror films additionally aim to evoke viewers' nightmares, fears,
            revulsions and terror of the unknown or the macabre. Initially
            inspired by literature from authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram
            Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has existed as a film genre for
            more than a century. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy,
            supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.

            In film and television, drama is a category of narrative fiction (or
            semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone.[1]
            Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that
            specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre,
            such as soap opera (operatic drama), police crime drama, political
            drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama,
            and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a
            particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the
            otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a
            broader range of moods.

            The American Film Institute defines Western films as those 'set in
            the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the
            demise of the new frontier.'The term 'Western', used to describe a
            narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912
            article in Motion Picture World magazine.[8] Most of the
            characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular
            western fiction, and were firmly in place before film became a
            popular art form.

            Thriller is a genre of fiction, having numerous, often overlapping
            subgenres. Thrillers are characterized and defined by the moods they
            elicit, giving viewers heightened feelings of suspense, excitement,
            surprise, anticipation and anxiety. Successful examples of thrillers
            are the films of Alfred Hitchcock.
